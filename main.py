# You should implement the methods in the order of the numbers each method has assigned to it
# E.g start with nr #1 load_data, then move on to nr #2 the __init__-method
# This is just a recommendation, it's up to you!

# Methods in the "Menu" class will usually have a corresponding or related method in the "VideoGameDatabase" class
# This means that usually the Menu will have methods that call the methods in the VideoGameDatabase class
# Feel free to add a few more methods if needed (optional)

# The purpose of this lab is to practice on separation of concerns.
# The VideoGameDatabase class should only be responsible for handling the data, while the Menu class is responsible for the presentation logic (print, input, etc)
# The Database-class should raise exceptions when needed, and the Menu is the only responsible for handling these exceptions
# In practice, we should be able to use the Database-class with other classes that might want to use the same data
# Such as a tkinter-based app, or a web application.
